# UE4 Survival Game
Making a Survival Game with Unreal Engine, using C++ and Blueprints.

Following the course from Reuben Ward available at his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/reubenward/posts) for 25 USD. Trying to brush up my C++ skills and learn UE4 as I go.

The project requires lots of assets that are too big to upload to the repository, and can be downloaded via a link if the course is bought.
